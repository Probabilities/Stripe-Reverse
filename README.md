# Stripe-Reverse
This repository is a full reverse of the request payload that is used on the https://m.stripe.com/6 post request (commonly referred to as the "init" request since it returns muid, guid &amp; sid which are required when interacting with stripe). This is purely POC and should not be used for unethical purposes.
